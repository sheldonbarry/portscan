# portscan
Simple Python TCP port scanner

## Usage
   
First, instantiate an instance of the class `ScanIP`, supplying an IP address as input. In the example, this is stored in a variable, `target`.
We can then call the `scan` method on target. (In the example, no list of ports is supplied as argument, so the default ports are used.)
The results (dictionary object) are stored in a variable `result`, which we then print to the terminal.
